A couple windows tools I thought would be useful.
As the compition rounds are getting increasinglt more difficult and are not longer just system hardening(securing) but fixing system tampering,
I thought these tools would be useful to diagnose network, process, system problems and locate hidden processes.

Use them if you would like, test them out or look up what they can do, all the tools provide a lot more services than I was able to list,
but are just some breif things that I thought could help us find more unqiue tasks.

If you guys have any other tools you want to add, add them here
